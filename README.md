# Basic_C-_Projects

There are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

Projects: 
Car Insurance
TwentyOne Game

Car Insurance: 
This project is an MVC Web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. 

TwentyOne Game:

This project is a console application that follows the rules of the game TwentyOne also known as BlackJack. It takes user input such as name and amount of bet and plays a game of TwentyOne.
